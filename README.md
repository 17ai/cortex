# Cortex

Neural networks, regression and feature learning in Clojure.


TODO:

* more activation functions (e.g. tanh)
* more loss functions (e.g. negative log likelihood)
* more layer types (e.g. dropout)

* composite layer types
 - port additive and multiplicative layers CMulTable, CAddTable from Torch for recurrent nets and LSTM
